            <p>
                This device is an 8-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. 
                It was first released in Japan on April 21, 1989. 
                The console was released in North America later the same year, then in Europe in late 1990.
                <br>
                Its design was done by Satoru Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research & Development 1.
                <br>
                It is Nintendo's second handheld game console, the Game Boy, which combines features from both the NES home system and Game & Watch hardware. 
                The console features a dot-matrix screen with adjustable contrast dial, five game control buttons (a directional pad, two game buttons, 
                and "START" and "SELECT"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial, and uses cartridges as physical media for games.
